What I have done this week: 
- Alternative wearable 
  - Created a new wearable using the premade gel electrodes
  - Performs no better than the original wearable with fabric electrodes
  - Found that wetting the conductive fabric greatly reduces noise in the 
    EMG signal.

- Contacted the rec center and setup a time to gather experimental data

- Began to port Thanh's algorithm into MATLAB

- Revised the testing plan to include more specifics and update information


What I will do next week:
- Go to the rec center on Friday with the team and collect data

- Finish the MATLAB port of the algorithm


Any issues or obstacles I had this week:
- Need to clarify the format of ADC values in the algorithm (float OR int?)
