What I have done this week:
- Data collection
  - 35 new data sets (4 sets X 9 subjects)
- MATLAB
  - Worked with Hai to functionalize the batch processing
  - Completed initial run of analysis
  - Created PowerPoint of results
- Poster
  - Worked with Thanh on design
  - Made revisions and additions to first draft


What I will do next week:
- MATLAB
  - Incorporate new data into analysis
  - More processing as necessary as we refine and check the algorithm
  - Further automate the batch processing for easier and more robust analyis

- Poster
  - Make necessary changes and finalize for printing


Any issues or obstacles I had this week:
- New data collected is in a different format and needs to be either 
  reformatted or the MATLAB needs to be modified to deal with it
