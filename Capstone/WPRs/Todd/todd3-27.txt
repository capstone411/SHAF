********************************************************************************

What I have done this week: 
- Connected the wearable to the muscle sensor and measured the output
  with a multimeter to verify that a signal is being generated with
  muscle activation.

What I will do next week:
- Connect the same wearable/muscle sensor setup to an oscilloscope to
  capture data

- Compare captured data to older electrode data  

- Make another wearable if the current one is a success, OR,
  design a different wearble if the current one does not produce
  acceptable data. 

Any issues or obstacles I had this week:
- I did not make it to the lab over spring break to use the
  oscilloscope so I did not accomplish everything I wanted to.
