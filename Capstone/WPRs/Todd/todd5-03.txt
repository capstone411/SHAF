What I have done this week: 
- MATLAB
  - Got the rep and fatigue detection algorithm in a functional state
  - Set up a script that can run all the Arduino data through the algorithm
    and generate a basic report


What I will do next week:
- MATLAB
  - Decide on a method for setting the rep detection voltage threshold for 
    each data set
  - Improve the batch processing report to help with refining the algorithm


Any issues or obstacles I had this week:
- MATLAB
  - The rep detection algorithm depends on a voltage threshold value which is
    presumably set during a calibration phase.  Our data collected from the
    rec center does not have this calibration rep included.  My solution right
    now is to use the first rep detected as a sort of calibration.  I will 
    discuss the matter further with the team at our next meeting.
