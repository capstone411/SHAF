********************************************************************************

What I have done this week: 
  
  Nothing.  Studied for finals and enjoyed the weekend.  :-)


What I will do next week:

  Using an oscilloscope, I will verify that the wearble garment produces an 
  EMG signal similar to the gel electrodes.

  If the garment produces an adequete signal, I will produce another 
  garment so we have more than one.


Any issues or obstacles I had this week:
  
  None
