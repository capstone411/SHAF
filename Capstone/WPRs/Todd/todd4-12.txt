********************************************************************************

What I have done this week: 
- Tested the custom wearable with Thanh's experimental setup

- Created an interaction diagram for initiating Bluetooth 
  communication between our device running on Arduino and an iPhone

- Created a hierarchy of Bluetooth protocols



What I will do next week:
- Explore different wearable options.  Leading candidate: integrating
  the gel electrodes with our wearable to try and clean up the signal
  to the muscle sensor.

- Explore the possibility of refining the rep and fatigue detection
  code to be more robust and handle the noisier wearable signal

- Refine the Bluetooth design document and finalize decisions with
  the group.

- Explore any possible remaining issues or concerns with the 
  data collection experimental setup.



Any issues or obstacles I had this week:
- The custom-made wearable produces a noisier and more variable
  signal compared to the gel electrodes.  It does not work well when
  used with the current rep-counting and fatigue-checking software.
