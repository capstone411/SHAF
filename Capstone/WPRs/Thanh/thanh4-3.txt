What I've done this week:
- Modified the main program of our project
- Find a program to communicate with Adruino serially (TeraTerm)
- Find a solution to compare the analog generating by Adruino with the graph on the oscilloscope (not real time)

What I will do next week:
- Start testing with test subjects
- Fix bug if found

Obstacle:
- Somehow I can't upload my code to Adruino through my usb cable. The temporal fix is using the AVR Dragon ISP
  in the capstone lab to upload my code.
