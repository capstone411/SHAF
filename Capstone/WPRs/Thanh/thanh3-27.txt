What I've done this week:
- Install Ubuntu 14 into MinnowBoard MAX
- Install MRAA libarary for all GPIO mapping
- Write sample codes testing GPIO pins and I2C pins

What I will do next week:
- Work with analog input
- Write codes to detect correct reps and fatigue

Obstacle:
- The connection between HDMI cable with our monitor isn't stable
- MinnowBoard MAX don't have I/O for analog
