What I have done this week:

- Install Ubuntu 14.04.4 on Minnowboard Max
- Import mraa library to interface GPIO
- Write simple code to blink LED
- Order bluetooth 4.0


What I will do next week:

- Write simple code to interface I2C on Minnowboard
- Figure out bluetooth 4.0 with Minnowboard Max



Any issues or obstacles I had this week

- There are some problem about downloading file for updating new firmware for MinnowBoard Max

- Stuck in installing Ubuntu and firmware for MinnowBoard Max
I should boot Ubuntu on USB 2.0 rather than USB 3.0

- There is no Bluetooth module. I try to buy bluetooth version 4.0 to interface with MinnowBoard Max

- I try to connect Bluetooth from my iPhone with my virtual machine (Running Ubuntu), but it does not work.
