What I have done this week

Discuss Bluetooth issue with Ahmed and Todd
Write code bluetooth shield can detect and connect to the iPhone



What I will do next week:

Order new 4.0 bluetooth supporting UUID for Ahmed's app
redo again for setting connection between bluetooth shield and iPhone for new board


Issues:

The bluetooth shield from seedstudio does not support UUID
It is not suitable for IOS app because IOS need bluetooth 4.0.
--> Alternative way: order new bluetooth that support bluetooth 4.0 and UUID
