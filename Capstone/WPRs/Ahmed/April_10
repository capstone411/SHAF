What I've done this week:

- Helped set up testing the wearable and getting data for next week
- Ordered new bluetooth 4.0 sheild for arduino

What I'll do next week:

- Keep working on bluetooth communication
- Test the wearable and get data from around 50 subjects

Issues:

- New bluetooth 4.0 shield is missing some components
- Need to solder the bluetooth shield (not just something I can attach on the arduino)
