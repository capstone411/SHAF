Arduino/iPhone Bluetooth Testing Plan

General Plan

1)  Initialize BT on Arduino to advertise a service with at least one 
    data characteristic and at least one control characteristic

2)  Pair an iPhone with the Arduino via the service

3)  Using the iPhone, start a data producing program on the Arduino via
    the control characteristic 

4)  The data producing program on the Arduino will update the data 
    characteristic of the service

5)  Observe the updates to the data characteristic on the iPhone

6)  Using the iPhone, stop the data producing program on the Arduino
    via the control characteristic

7)  Observe the lack of updates to the data characteristic on the iPhone
